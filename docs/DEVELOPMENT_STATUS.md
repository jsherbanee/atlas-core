# Atlas Core Development Status

## Current State
Atlas Core is in active Phase 2 Bid Intelligence development with a stabilization baseline candidate prepared.

## Quality Status (Latest Full Run)
- black .: passing
- ruff check .: passing
- mypy .: passing
- pytest: 868 passed, 50 warnings

## Tooling Status
- GitHub Actions configured
  - .github/workflows/python.yml
- Pre-commit configured
  - .pre-commit-config.yaml

## Active Focus
Finalize and harden the Phase 2 Bid Intelligence baseline before any downstream lifecycle expansion.

## Latest Completed Feature
- Estimator Brief Enhancements (deterministic executive summary, prioritized reviewer actions, and evidence traceability)

## Baseline Candidate Notes
- Conceptual label: phase-2-bid-intelligence-baseline-candidate (not a Git tag yet).
- Phase 2 snapshot-style tests cover representative MAW plan review and revision comparison outputs.
- MAW remains canonical sample/reference data only (not hardcoded product logic in core services).
- Phase 3+ workflows remain out of active orchestration scope for this baseline.

## Last Known Next Task Sequence
1. Drawing/spec intelligence refinements
2. PDF ingestion and indexing refinements
3. Device schedule extraction refinements
